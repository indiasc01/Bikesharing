NYC Citibike Analysis

Purpose: We were given data to help visualize bike sharing in New York.

Results:
From the data collected and displayed, we can look at the "Trips by Weekday" table and see that the most popular day to use bike sharing is Thursday between 5-6pm. We can also see looking at this graph that users tend to use bike sharing between work hours and weekends. On the graph "Checkout Times by Gender", men are mostly the ones who check out bikes with the an amount of 108,000, while females are less likely to check out bikes with a total of 33,000. We can also see that when users checkout bikes, they mostly use it for at most 10 minutes. In the graph "August peak hours", it shows when riders are most likely to checkout bikes during the day in August, which shows hour 8 and 17 are the peak hours in this month.
